								<h2>Unsteady propulsion by an intermittent swimming gait</h2>
							</header>
							<hr />
							<p> Many fish and marine mammals swim by using a combination of an active swimming phase and a passive coasting phase known as burst-and-coast or burst and-glide swimming. This intermittent swimming gait adopted by fish, has been predicted by dynamical models to yield an energy saving to swim a given distance of over 50%. It is hypothesized that a fish may reduce its overall skin friction drag by interspersing an undulation phase with a coasting phase. The skin friction increase is caused by the thinning of the boundary layer from the body-normal velocity component that is present during undulation.</p>
							<p>We discovered an additional inviscid mechanism controlled by the ratio of the undulation time to the coasting time of the fish. This mechanism can save intermittent swimmers as much as 60% of the energy it takes to swim continuously at the same speed. The inviscid energy savings are shown to increase with increasing amplitude of motion. In addition, previous thrust and power scaling laws of continuous self-propelled swimming are further generalized to include intermittent swimming. The key is that by averaging the thrust and power coefficients over only the bursting period then the intermittent problem can be transformed into a continuous one. </p>

								<h2>Large-Amplitude Intermittent Swimming in Viscous and Inviscid Flows</h2>
							</header>
							<hr />
							<p> We demonstrated that the benefit of intermittent gait increases as the amplitude of motion increases. However, as the amplitude of motion increases, the assumption of no-flow separation from the leading edge of the swimmer breaks. To understand the limits of the benefits of intermittent motion, both viscous and inviscid physics should be taken into consideration.</p>
							<p>In this respect, we considered viscous and inviscid flow simulations of a hydrofoil pitching intermittently with large-amplitude motions. It is observed that leading-edge vortex formation and shedding in a viscous flow significantly alter the wake dynamics from the inviscid flow solutions where only trailing-edge shedding is modeled. Despite the flow field differences, the trends in the force production and energetics seen in a viscous flow are well captured by the inviscid flow simulations. Importantly, both predict energy savings on the order of 10%-30% for intermittent swimming and that the energy savings increase when the amplitude of motion is increased even when significant leading-edge separation occurs.</p>
